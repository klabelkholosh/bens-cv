Hello!

I've developed / co-authored 2 NFT claim sites, using a combination of React / Next.js / Redux / Web3.js / Tailwind CSS and other techs. 

For both of these I was also the NFT artist, and developed the art assets/design of the sites themselves, and for the first project, I also developed the Solidity smart contract. 

The 1st project can be viewed at https://www.6clocks.wtf/, the second at https://theta-minting.vercel.app/ (although mint/claim not live yet for 2nd project).

I also attempt to create generative art NFTs under the moniker 'klabelkholosh', my twitter here is https://twitter.com/klabby_art/, and art portfolio site is at https://www.klabby.art/
